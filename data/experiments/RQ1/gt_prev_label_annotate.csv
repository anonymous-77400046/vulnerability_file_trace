Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA , DSA and DH private keys are impossible . This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice . Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input . Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation . Impact was not analyzed in detail , because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely .
